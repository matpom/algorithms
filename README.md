# Algorithms

Some code samples and notes taken by me while completing [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/info) (Princeton University) Coursera course. 

#### Disclaimer:
Many of the classes do not follow SOLID principles or any good coding practices but it is not the goal of this project.
I also decided not unit test this most of the code as it would consume too much time.
